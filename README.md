> [!WARNING]
> **Pre-1.0.** ZapTrace is a verification-first EDA kernel, not a fabrication guarantee. All generated outputs require human engineering review before fabrication or use. See [Safety Disclaimer](#safety-disclaimer).

> [!NOTE]
> **Proof Pack = evidence layer, not absolute correctness.** Proof packs record configured checks, artifacts, assumptions, and pass/fail evidence. A clean proof pack does not mean a board is manufacturer-approved, production-ready, or safe to fabricate without review.

## What ZapTrace Is

- **A Python SDK** for programmatic electronics design — parse, validate, place, route, export.
- **A CLI** (`zaptrace`) for quick design iteration from the terminal.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- **An MCP server** (`zaptrace-mcp`) that exposes 90 agent-facing tools to AI agents.
=======
- **An MCP server** (`zaptrace-mcp`) that exposes 90 agent-facing tools to AI agents.
>>>>>>> 34074d3 (feat: Altium import fidelity corpus gate + MCP tool (issue #137))
- **A REST API** for web-based design workflows.
- **A verification engine** — Electrical Rule Checking (ERC) + Design Rule Checking (DRC) baked in.
- **A manufacturing export pipeline** — Gerber RS-274X, Excellon drill, BOM, pick-and-place, KiCad.
- **A proof-pack generator** — auditable, reproducible artifact bundles for every design.

## What ZapTrace Is Not

- ❌ **Not a replacement for KiCad, Altium, or Eagle** — ZapTrace is a *backend engine*, not a full PCB editor GUI.
- ❌ **Not a SPICE simulator** — no analog simulation (yet).
- ❌ **Not a replacement for human engineering judgment** — all outputs require review before fabrication.
- ❌ **Not fabrication-proven** — ZapTrace is pre-1.0. Manufacturing outputs are experimental.
- ❌ **Not fabrication-ready or production-ready** — no claim of fitness for manufacturing is made.
- ❌ **Proof Pack is not a correctness guarantee** — it is an evidence layer that records what was checked and what passed/failed. Absence of errors does not mean the design is correct or manufacturable.
- ❌ **KiCad Oracle (ERC/DRC) is external validation, not absolute correctness** — it catches rule violations the rules know about. A passing KiCad Oracle check does not guarantee a working circuit.
- ❌ **Fab profiles are not manufacturer approvals** — built-in profiles match common manufacturer capabilities, but you must verify against your specific manufacturer's current specifications. Always obtain pre-fabrication approval.
- ❌ **GitHub hardware CI cannot catch all hardware errors** — CI runs on simulated or limited hardware; physical validation (probe, power-up, functional test) is irreplaceable.

## v0.3.0 Release Scope

ZapTrace 0.3.0 is an evidence-hardening release. It adds bounded autonomous sign-off vocabulary, requirements coverage, assumption evidence, KiCad oracle evidence, manufacturing/DFM evidence, component/datasheet/footprint provenance, layout/power/SI/PI risk reports, known-failure benchmark mutation coverage, and Review Studio benchmark readiness panels.

This release still makes no fabrication-readiness claim. A pass means the configured evidence gates did not block; it does **not** mean the design is manufacturer-approved, production-ready, or safe to fabricate without human engineering review.

---

curl http://localhost:8000/erc/my_design
```

See [docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for REST API setup and usage.

---

## Manufacturing Export

ZapTrace generates all files needed for PCB fabrication:

| Artifact | Format | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Copper layers | Gerber RS-274X | ✅ |
| Drill file | Excellon | ✅ |
| Bill of Materials | CSV / JSON | ✅ |

| Design report | Markdown | ✅ |

```bash
# Generate everything
zaptrace export manufacturing my_design --output build/board
```

---

## Proof Pack

A Proof Pack is an auditable, reproducible artifact bundle that explains what ZapTrace generated and why.

```bash
zaptrace proof-pack design.yaml --output build/proof-pack
```

Each proof pack contains:
- Design inputs and normalized model
- ERC results (what was checked and what passed/failed)
- DRC results
- BOM and supply-chain overview
- All manufacturing artifacts
- Decision log
- Reproducibility metadata
- Warnings and review checklist

See [docs/strategy/proof-pack-spec.md](docs/strategy/proof-pack-spec.md) for details.

---

## Verification Model

ZapTrace uses a layered verification model. Each layer produces evidence; none is a correctness guarantee.

### Evidence Layers

| Layer | What It Does | What It Does NOT Do |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Parser** | Validates design YAML structure and constraints | Does not verify circuit functionality |
| **ERC (29 rules)** | Checks electrical rules (net connectivity, pin compatibility, power, power-tree, DNP-aware) | Does not simulate the circuit or verify timing |
| **DRC (16 rules)** | Checks physical design rules (clearance, width, drill) | Does not guarantee manufacturability |
| **KiCad Oracle** | Exports to KiCad and runs KiCad's ERC/DRC as external validation | KiCad may have different rules; a pass does not mean the design is correct |
| **Proof Pack** | Records all verification results, artifact hashes, environment metadata, and decisions | Evidence of what was checked, not a guarantee of correctness |
| **Fab Profiles** | Documents manufacturer capabilities (min trace, min drill, layers) | Not a manufacturer approval; always verify with your fab house |
| **GitHub Hardware CI** | Runs hardware-level integration checks on available runners | Cannot reproduce all real-world hardware conditions; physical testing required |

### What "Verification-First" Means

- Verification is **built into the pipeline**, not bolted on after export.
- Every design artifact has an auditable chain: who checked what, with which tool, and what result.
- The design pipeline stops on hard errors (ERC/DRC failures) and requires explicit override.
- **Human engineering review is mandatory** before fabrication. No automated tool can replace domain expertise.

### Non-Claims

ZapTrace does **not** claim:

- **Fabrication-ready** — no automated verification pipeline can guarantee a board will fabricate correctly.
- **Production-ready** — pre-1.0; APIs and outputs may change.
- **Manufacturer-approved** — fab profiles are reference configurations, not approvals.
- **Guaranteed correctness** — all verification tools have blind spots.
- **Fully automatic manufacturing** — every manufacturing output requires human review and fab house approval.

## Roadmap

| Horizon | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **Current (v0.3.0)** | Evidence hardening: proof-pack sign-off, KiCad oracle gates, governed component/datasheet/footprint evidence, layout/power/SI/PI reports, benchmark corpus, Review Studio readiness panel |
| **Next** | Real board-family fixture expansion: requirements, golden KiCad projects, proof packs, manufacturing exports, mutation cases for all 12 manifest families |
| **Later** | Larger component library, live distributor integrations, deeper routing fidelity, solver-grade SI/PI/thermal integrations, multi-board workflows |

See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the full roadmap.

## Current Limitations

- **Pre-1.0**: APIs are unstable and may change without notice.
- **No interactive PCB GUI**: Primary surfaces are CLI, SDK, MCP, REST, generated artifacts, and Review Studio evidence views.
- **No fabrication approval**: No claim of manufacturing readiness is made; all outputs require qualified human engineering review.
- **Heuristic analysis**: Current thermal, SI/PI, impedance, current-density, and power reports are evidence pre-checks, not solver-grade sign-off.
- **Algorithmic routing**: Routing is grid/net-aware, but not a professional push-and-shove interactive router.
- **Bounded synthesis**: Synthesis is block/template/requirements driven, not open-ended from-scratch invention for arbitrary circuits.
- **Limited package/library breadth**: Many module, DFN/LGA/aQFN/RJ45/RF land patterns still require datasheet-backed geometry expansion.
- **KiCad Oracle is external validation**: KiCad's own ERC/DRC has limitations. A passing check does not guarantee circuit functionality.
- **Fab profiles are not manufacturer approval**: Always verify against your specific fab house and current manufacturer capabilities.
- **Benchmark pass is regression evidence**: It does not imply fabrication safety or production readiness.
- **GitHub hardware CI ≠ physical testing**: CI cannot reproduce all real-world failure modes.
- **KiCad export is primarily outbound**: Import/round-trip fidelity is still a future hardening area.
- **Plugin system is experimental**: Signed-runtime policy exists, but production sandboxing requires further hardening.
