"""Functional-core synthesis: instantiate the MCU and wire it to the board.

Block-composition synthesis (:mod:`zaptrace.synthesis.architecture`) emits the
*support* circuitry — regulators, pull-ups, transceivers, termination — but no
brain. This module adds the functional core: it loads the real MCU part for the
requested family from the library, places it, ties its power pins to the logic
rail, and assigns its GPIOs to the interface support nets already on the board
(I2C SDA/SCL, RS-485 control, CAN TXD/RXD).

That turns a pile of support blocks into a *connected system*: the data nets that
were single-pin (a pull-up with nothing on the other end) now reach the MCU.

Deterministic: GPIO pins are assigned in natural order to interfaces in a fixed
order, so the same requirements always produce the same pin map. Honest: a family
with no library part, or an interface with no support net, is reported, never
faked.
