"""Peripheral synthesis: place real sensors and hang them on the MCU's bus.

Functional-core synthesis (:mod:`zaptrace.synthesis.mcu`) gives the board a brain
and an I2C bus, but nothing to talk to. This adds the peripherals the intent asks
for: it picks a real sensor part for the requested measurement, places it, ties
its power pins to the rail, and drops it onto the existing I2C bus (the same SDA/
SCL nets the MCU and pull-ups are on). The result fulfils the intent — an "I2C
temperature sensor board" gets an actual temperature sensor, not an empty bus.

Deterministic: sensor selection is keyword-driven with a fixed rule order, and
parts mount in that order. Honest: a measurement with no library part, or an
intent with no I2C bus to hang a sensor on, is reported, never faked.
