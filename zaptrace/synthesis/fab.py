"""End-to-end: intent → fabricable package + evidence.

Chains block-composition synthesis through the existing place / route / export
pipeline so an agent can go from one sentence to a manufacturing bundle (Gerber,
drill, BOM, pick-and-place, ZIP) in a single call — the "Prompt-to-Fab" thesis,
on the composition synthesizer rather than template selection.

Crucially it returns the **evidence** alongside the artifacts: the completeness
scorecard, the DC bias check, and an explicit human-review checklist of what is
*not* finished (parts with no copper, ERC left for review, undriven rails,
unrealized blocks, a skipped simulation). The bundle is never presented as
fabrication-ready — the checklist is the honest hand-off to a reviewer.
