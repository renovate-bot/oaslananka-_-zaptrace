"""Connector synthesis: give the board the physical input it needs.

Power-input synthesis emits the USB-C CC termination resistors but no actual
receptacle — so the synthesized board had nothing to plug into and its CC nets
dangled at a single resistor. This places the real USB-C connector from the
library and wires VBUS / GND / CC1 / CC2 / shield, turning the CC nets into real
two-terminal connections and giving the board a power source.

D+/D- and the sideband pins are left unconnected: a power-only USB-C input does
not use them, and inventing a connection would be wrong.
