# ZapTrace

**Agent-native electronics design core** — PCB EDA via LLM agents and MCP.

ZapTrace is a Python-first EDA engine designed to be driven by AI agents through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides a full stack of electrical design automation: schematic synthesis, ERC/DRC/DFM rule engines, BOM management, manufacturing export, and proof-pack signoff — all accessible through a clean, versioned API.

## What ZapTrace Does

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **ERC** | 29 electrical rule checks, from floating pins to PDN headroom |
| **DRC** | PCB layout checks: clearance, drill, via-to-via, courtyard |
| **DFM** | SMD, footprint, pick-and-place manufacturability checks |
| **BOM** | Line-item export, supply risk scoring, distributor adapters |
| **Manufacturing** | Gerber RS-274X, IPC-2581, IDF 2.0, SES, Eagle XML |
| **Synthesis** | Testpoint insertion, RF trace width, net naming, placement AI |
| **Agent Runtime** | Budget sandbox, prompt-injection detection, replayable session log |
| **Review Studio** | Panel aggregation, human checklist workflow, signoff decisions |
| **MCP** | Full tool suite exposed via Model Context Protocol |

## Non-claims

!!! warning "ZapTrace is a heuristic engine, not a signoff tool"
    - All ERC/DRC/DFM outputs are **best-effort heuristics**, not certified signoff.
    - Electrical analysis uses **closed-form approximations**, not field solvers.
    - BOM risk scores are **indicative only** — always verify with your distributor.
    - Agent decisions are **subject to human review** before tape-out.
